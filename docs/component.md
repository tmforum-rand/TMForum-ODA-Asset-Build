# Definition
All components are preceded by a metadata field 
- Core function: Describes the list of resources that make up the component. It is divided into:
    - Exposed apis
    - Dependant apis
    - Published events
    - Security functions
All resources in the component manifest must be labelled for the controller to assigned them to the component.

# Builing a new component envelope:
List of required resources:
- Kubernetes Manifests
- Api reference implementation for each exposed api
- ODA component ctk

## Features to add to tmf ri
- Add environment variables to to allow external api path configuration
- Add home resource at root
- Change default swagger ui path

## Create party role initialisattion
This is a script that creates party role objects in the database

## Test component envelope using component CTK 
Use the static tests of the oda component ctk validate the generated kubenertes manifests of the component.
Once validated install the component and run the dynamic tests.



# Asset types
The produced assets by the oda project can be divided between autogenerated and developed. 
The development of autogenerated assets are compiled from other sources including the developed assets. They don't have a dedicated development lifecycle
Developed assets in the other hand require a dedicated development lifecycle also require tooling for development automation. 
## Autogenerated assets
    - ODA component ctks
    - ODA reference implementation

## Developed assets
    - ODA component spec (v1beta1, v1beta2 etc..)
    - ODA component core ctk
    - ODA canvas core ctk
